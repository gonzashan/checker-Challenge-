# Repte #2 - Welcome to Lambdas Æ›

This exercise will be based on developing 3 lambda functions that exist within a class called MyLambda and that allows us to find the following:

    isOdd: the lambda expression must return true if the number is even and false if the number is odd. 
    'Be aware, because is Upside Down.

    isPrime: the lambda expression must return true if the number is prime and false if it is not.

    isPalindrome: the lambda expression must return true if the number is palindrome and false if the number is not.

    checker: method of the class that allows us to use (isOdd, isPalindrome, isPrime) when passing an array of numbers 
    to review and must return a list of numbers and whether it is Even or Odd, Primo and / or Palindrome.
    
    
  #Data entry

     Each function has as input the number to be checked and returns only true or false.

     In case the past input is <= 0 it must always return false.

     checker input | output:
